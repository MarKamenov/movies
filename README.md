# Responsive app (Frontend)

### Introduction

Simple SPA based off the provided mockup and make a few API calls to a public web API.

### Functionality

The search page should enable the user to search for movies as keywords are typed into the search bar. Functionality for filtering does not need to be implemented, however the filter categories should still be expandable upon clicking. Other than the search functionality, no other functionality is expected.

Movie data can be queried via:

- [theMovieDB]

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks. You can find the most recent version of this guide here.

Create React App is divided into two packages:

create-react-app is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects. react-scripts is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one). You almost never need to update create-react-app itself: it delegates all the setup to react-scripts.

When you run create-react-app, it always creates the project with the latest version of react-scripts so youâ€™ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.

yarn test Runs tests. Testing is still in progress.

For state management we use Mobxjs

These files must exist with exact filenames:

public/index.html is the page template; src/index.js or if using typescipt index.tsx is the JavaScript entry point. Available Scripts In the project directory, you can run:

yarn start Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
